Single Application
A concise, single-page application built using core web technologies. This project demonstrates a straightforward approach to building interactive and responsive web experiences without relying on large frameworks.
🚀 Technologies Used
This project is built using the fundamental pillars of web development:
HTML5: Used for the core structure and semantic content.
CSS3: Used for styling, layout, and responsiveness.
JavaScript (ES6+): Used for all dynamic behavior, interactivity, and application logic.
🛠️ Installation and Setup
Since this is a client-side application using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, no complex installation or build process is required.

cd single-application2. Run the application
Simply open the main file, usually index.html, in your web browser.
Right-click on index.html and select "Open with" -> [Your preferred browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)]
Alternatively, for local development, you may want to use a simple local server (like the Live Server extension in VS Code) to avoid any cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) issues, although this is often optional for basic projects.
